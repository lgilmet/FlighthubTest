# How to test this app

## Project Set Up

- Install Xampp and start Apache server.

- Download from git into the `C:\xampp\htdocs\` or corresponding folder.

## Run Project

- To access the site, open this link in your browser. http://localhost/FlighthubTest/QueryUser.php 

- Choose origin city and destination city and click the "Search for flights" button. 

- A JSON file is created by the program and can be found at `C:\xampp\htdocs\FlighthubTest\data\response.json`

## Limitations

There are a few limitations in the API. It does not take in dates for flights and only calculates round trips. I focused on round trips with many flights as it was the main challenge. The API does not take in a JSON request at the moment but it could. Instead I made it so you can choose different cities to find flights between. 

Currently the API finds all the combinations of flights to complete a round trip regardless of distance or times. 


# Trip Builder Test Instruction

## Outline 
An airline has a name and is identified by a IATA Airline Code.
Ex: Air Canada (AC)
An airport is a location identified by a IATA Airport Code. It also has a name, a city, latitude and
longitude coordinates, a timezone and a city code, the IATA Airport Code for a city, which may
differ from an airport code in larger areas.
Ex: Pierre Elliott Trudeau International (YUL) belongs to the Montreal (YMQ) city code.
A flight is uniquely numbered for a referenced airline. For the sake of simplicity, a flight is priced
for a single passenger (any gender, any type) in a neutral currency and is available every day of
the week. Timezones are also ignored. It references a pair of airports for departure and arrival.
Ex: AC301 from YUL to YVR departs at 7:35 AM (Montreal) and arrives at 10:05 AM (Vancouver).

## Your Mission

Create an API to build and navigate trips for a single passenger using criteria such as
departure airport, departure dates and arrival airport. Be mindful of timezones!
A trip references one or many flights, each one departing after the arrival date of the previous
flight. A tripâ€™s price is the sum of the prices of the referenced flights.
The following trip types MUST be supported:
- A one-way is a trip getting from A to B (i.e. 1+ flights)
- A round-trip is a trip getting from A to B, and then from B to A (i.e. 2+ flights)


### Technical Requirements

- Server-side application MUST be written in PHP
- The resulting project MUST be version-controlled and available online (e.g. GitHub)
- Easy to follow instructions MUST be provided to provision an environment, install and run the application locally on a PC (Windows or Linux) and/or Mac

### How to Earn Extra Considerations

- Deploy the application online to ease the review process
- Scale beyond sample data (see below)
- Use data storage(s) provisioned within the environment
- Implement automated software tests
- Document the API
- Allow flights to be restricted to a preferred airline
- Sort trip listings (e.g. by price, trip duration, # of stops)
- Paginate trip listings
